# browserd/stream-consumer

Represents the component that recieves content from the cloud 🤕☁✨

[![Build Status](Build CI not yet added)


This component will represent a simple static webpage that can connect to a [stream-provider](../stream-provider). It will be able to send input to and recieve content from an electron based app runnning in a container on the cloud. 

## Signaling server

Our service is compatible with any standard WebRTC signaling implementation. If you need a simple one that communicates over HTTP/1.1, [webrtc-signal-http](https://github.com/bengreenier/webrtc-signal-http) is a good option.

## Configuration

Our service can be configured using a [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) file - `.env` containing one environment variable
key and value per line. For example `KEY=value`. Below are the possible options:

+ `SERVICE_URL` (string) - the web service address (to render)
+ `TURN_URL` (string) - a turn address
+ `TURN_USERNAME` (string) - a turn username
+ `TURN_PASSWORD` (string) - a turn password credential
+ `POLL_URL` (string) - a signaling server base address
+ `POLL_INTERVAL` (number) - a signaling poll interval in ms
+ `HEIGHT` (number) - the window height
+ `WIDTH` (number) - the window width
+ `EXP_HIDE_STREAMER` (boolean) - experiment flag for hiding the streamer window
+ `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (string) - a Twilio AccountSid required to get a Network Traversal Service Token
+ `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (string) - a Twilio AuthToken required to get a Network Traversal Service Token

## Turn server

Our service supports both [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) and [Twilio's STUN/TURN service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/stun-turn).
In the dotenv file, if `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` values are set, our service will attempt to get a turn server from Twilio. Otherwise, you can leave them empty to use a stun server or coturn turn server.
